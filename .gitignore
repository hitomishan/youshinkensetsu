# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'


# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.


# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.

# Ignore uploaded files in development.


# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
